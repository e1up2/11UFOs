# 11UFO Sighting Analysis
# Overview of Analysis

## Purpose
This project was essentially about manipulating Javascript in order display UFO sighting data on a dynamic webpage. I focused on creating a website that allowed users to input certain search criteria and based on that search criteria, I adjusted and displayed the data back to the user. This webpage was developed by inserting Javascript into an HTML document and styled using CSS and Bootstrap.


# Results

## Using Search Criteria
While on this website, the user has 5 seperate options to filter the data by
1. Date
2. City
3. State
4. Country
5. UFO Shape
This allows the user to view the data in a great deal of ways. Below are just a couple
